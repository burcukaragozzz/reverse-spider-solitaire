This project was generated with [superplate](https://github.com/pankod/superplate).

## Getting Started

Sort cards on the tableau so they are in increasing order, from Ace to King. Once a full sequence of ranks is built, it automatically moves to the foundation (cards cannot be placed on the foundation individually). The game is won once all cards are in the foundation.
